Background
Life at Bucknell’s campus is vibrant and full of opportunities for students to be active. Additionally, visitors to campus often need to know about parking and events that are happening. There is an obvious need for an all around campus assistant that visitors, students, and faculty can use to stay up to date with what is happening on campus.



Executive Summary
A tool like this could take the form of an app and a web page. Both would have the same functionality, and having both would allow for visitors to campus to find resources they need without having to find an app they might not know about. The app should be able to provide the user with relevant campus events, available parking for visitors and students, and help facilitate community involvement in events through advertisements. Another feature of the app could be including a scheduler. LifeAtHere could, in addition to being a campus assistant, help visitors and students alike plan out there weekends with a scheduler.


Viability Analysis
A key piece of this project will be keeping the app up to date with relevant events. Ways to keep the app up to date would be to set up a script to scrape bucknell websites and automatically create new events based on what is posted on bucknell websites (like the main page, different athletic pages, weis center main page, etc). A different option would include creating a simple way to create a new event on the app and let, either through a whitelist or just by anybody, people post events. Both of these approaches could lead to unforeseen problems, so this needs to be thought of immediately. Other problems could be letting users use the app without service. Cell service at Bucknell and surrounding areas is not always the best, and this could prove problematic for users that come from out of town and are not prepared to lose service.


Risks and Rewards
The main risk in this app is that is doesn’t have much room to grow. A Bucknell campus assistant is an app that can only be used at Bucknell. On the other hand, the app could be developed in a way that leaves it more generally applicable. This could lead to a single campus assistant app that is used at schools across the country. In addition, the app could help keep the campus more organized with events that draw a lot of people come to campus. Another reward is the opportunity for monetizing the app. A campus assistant app could help advertise local shops, and these advertisements could be paid for. Moreso, a successful campus assistant will create a more connected campus because members of the community will be aware of events occurring at Bucknell. These events serve as venues for members to socialize and meet each other. Through more shared experiences, the campus becomes more inclusive and welcoming.


Closing
Bucknell is a campus that is always buzzing. Whether it is busy with an athletic event or the campus is hosting some national event, there is always something going on. Your day never goes as expected. Students and visitors alike are often interested in these events and other things that go on. At times the influxes of people can cause unexpected commotion on campus that leads to parking and other problems. An app that solves these issues would not only help Bucknell students, but could even lead to a whole new design for campus assistant apps.
